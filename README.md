# Algorithmic-Trading-Codes

Notes:
- Here, I set the notebook to my own working directory to read external data sources so it needs to be updated for external use of RealTimeArbitrage.ipynb notebook 
- Trading 500 pairs retreived from https://coinranking.com/exchange/-zdvbieRdZ+binance/markets?tenable.test=anything and saved in BinanceTradingPairs.xlsx
- Raw data pulled on 2024-02-17 between 14:09:16 and 16:30:08 saved as AskDataRaw.csv and BidDataRaw.csv so if anyone wants to repeat the analysis, this data can be directly used instead of pulling again
- All triangular arbitrage opportunities for the raw data above are given in ask_arbitrage_opportunity.csv and bid_arbitrage_opportunity.csv
